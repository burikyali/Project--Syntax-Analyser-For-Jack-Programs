# Project--Syntax-Analyser-For-Jack-Programs
Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham SEM 2 End Sem Project - Elements Of Computing (EOC)

Syntax Analyzer that parses Jack programs according to the Jack grammar, producing an XML file that renders the program's
structure using marked-up text.

The course gave us a better understanding of the modern software
hierarchy, introduced us to the fundamentals of Boolean algebra, and
helped us further comprehend how the modern computer functions. We
gained knowledge of the software nand2tetris as well as all the logic gates
that aided us.

We studied about many memory kinds. A and C instructions were covered, along with the bottom level of memory
hierarchy.

I had the opportunity to learn more about VM translator and Assembler. I
became known that the compiler changes the code to VM and then ASM in
order to hack a file (binary codes). I now understand the syntax of the Jack
programming language, how to write methods and constructors, and how
to tell Jack from Java in terms of usage and grammar.
I understood stack and its functions thanks to the VM chapter. I gained
knowledge about what I already knew about how RAM operates, how
various memory parts are split up inside, and why we need them.
